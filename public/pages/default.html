					<h1>Why</h1>
					<p>As a freelance I dont' know how my customers will behave with me, if it's going to be a good collaboration or if he is a very bad client.</p>
					<p>From this simple necessity I've decided to build this web app where you can rate and review your customer, providing a link to the job you've done, a comment and a rating.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="medium-6 columns">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="small-12 columns text-center">
						<span class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></span>
					</div>
				</div>
					<h1>How</h1>
					<p>I've decided to provide to you a very simple sistem to rate and review your current, past and future customers. It's very easy: you log in with facebook or with you email and password and then you can review those customers.</p>
					<p>Since your name would appear you have the responsability on what you'll write.</p>
